# MATLAB Circle and Diamond Shape Creation

## Description

This repository contains two MATLAB scripts that generate basic shapes (circle and diamond) on a 500x500 pixel canvas. These tasks demonstrate basic image manipulation techniques using MATLAB.

### Task 1: Circle Creation
The first script generates a white circle centered at (250, 250) with a radius of 100 pixels on a black background. The circle is created by calculating the distance of each pixel from the center and setting pixels within the radius to white.

### Task 2: Diamond Creation
The second script generates a white diamond shape centered at (250, 250) with a "radius" of 100 pixels. The shape is created using Manhattan distance to simulate a diamond form, where pixels within the specified distance are set to white.
